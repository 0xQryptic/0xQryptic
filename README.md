### üöÄ Currently Focusing On:

* **Python for Data Visualization & Web Services:** Applying Python to handle structured data (like JSON), interact with external APIs for geocoding and routing, and create interactive web-based maps with libraries like `Folium`.
* **Cybersecurity Fundamentals:** Actively deepening my understanding of core security and networking principles.
* **On-Device AI:** Continuing to explore the capabilities and potential of efficient models like Google's Gemma family.

### üõ†Ô∏è My Projects:

* **[Interactive Service Map](https://github.com/0xQryptic/interactive-service-map)** (In Progress): A web-based map to visualize technician/customer locations and optimize service routes. This project is my current focus, exploring data visualization, geocoding, and routing APIs.
* **[Python File Organizer](https://github.com/0xQryptic/python-file-organizer)**: A utility script to automatically sort files into categorized subfolders. A great exercise in file system operations using Python's `os` and `shutil` modules.
* **[Python Password Strength Checker](https://github.com/0xQryptic/python-password-checker)**: A command-line tool that assesses password strength based on multiple criteria. My first completed Python project, focusing on functions and iterative development.
